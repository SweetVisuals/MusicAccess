## How we built it
Music Access Studio is built with a modern tech stack:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite build system, ShadCN UI component library, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **Backend**: Supabase for authentication, database (PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities), and storage for audio files and assets.
- **Audio Processing**: Web Audio API integration and custom audio visualization components.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing Music Access Studio presented several significant challenges:
- **Context Window Limitations**: Managing a large and evolving project within the constraints of limited context windows proved challenging, requiring careful attention to information retrieval and processing efficiency.
- **Token Cost Management**: The extensive codebase and documentation, coupled with iterative development, led to considerable token costs, necessitating optimization strategies for tool usage and information processing.
- **Database Integration Complexities**: Integrating with the Supabase database, especially handling schema migrations, real-time capabilities, and ensuring robust data handling, required meticulous planning and execution to maintain data integrity and performance.
